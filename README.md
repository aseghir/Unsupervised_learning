# Unsupervised_learning

the goal of this project is to analyze app download behavior as well as other information related to consumers. the goal is to segment users based on unsupervised machine learning techniques.

STEP 1

Download all the files, a zip file is also availabe for your convenience. After extracting all the files, open any Python IDE (This project was created with Spyder) and change the working directory to the one with the folder containing all the files. OR, open the command prompt, go to the root directory with all the files, and write the command python exam.py to execute the python file.(It is better to open the python file in an IDE to make sure all the dependencies are installed correctly and the code is error free.)

STEP 2 Install the dependencies and execute the code.

STEP 3 Open the file called Abderraouf_Seghir_Exam.pdf to read the report.

STEP 4 do not hesitate to get in touch regarding any feedback or questions :)

Thank you.
